#OBSOLETE#
These crates are no longer maintained and the use case is better served by the [WebAssembly Component specification](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support/rust.html).

A low-ish level tool for easily writing WASM based plugins to be hosted by
wasm_plugin_host.

The goal of wasm_plugin is to make communicating across the host-plugin
boundary as simple and idiomatic as possible while being unopinionated
about how you actually use the plugin.

Plugins are meant to be run using [wasm_plugin_host](https://crates.io/crates/wasm_plugin_host)

Exporting a function is just a matter of adding an attribute.

```rust
#[wasm_plugin_guest::export_function]
fn hello() -> String {
    "Hello, host!".to_string()
}
```

## API Stability

I am not currently guaranteeing any stability, expect all releases to include breaking changes.
